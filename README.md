Jewel M. Rachel B., Datamining, Mentor: David Shen

The plan for our data mining project is to see the reviews of certain categories, submitting them into subcategories. With these new subcategories, we are able to see the correlations between certain words.   Not only will we be able to see and process this, but we will see how the rating of the reviews reflect on how the review was rated by other account holders and whether or not they found any help with the review left. With this we will want to see if the reviews that were rated the most helpful were negative or positive, allowing us to see if there is a relationship between the type of review it is, whether a positive one of negative one.
